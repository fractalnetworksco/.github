Fractal Networks is a non-venture backed U.S. startup with an international team dedicated to delivering delightful self-hosted user experiences. We build free and open source software with the intent of delivering robust digital privacy and cybersecurity capabilites to the next generation of Internet citizens. 

Our primary mission is to bootstrap a sustainable, community powered ecosystem built around free software and the conscious commercialization of self-hosted products and services. We believe that everyone should have the ability and the right to run their own software and own their own data.

We hope that you will find the tools here useful and welcome contributions!
