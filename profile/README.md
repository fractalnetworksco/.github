## The Fractal Network Company


The Fractal Network Company is a non-venture backed U.S. startup with an international team dedicated to bringing self-hosting to the mainstream. We build free and open source tools that deliver robust digital privacy and cybersecurity capabilites to the next generation of Internet citizens. 

Our primary mission is to bootstrap a sustainable, community powered ecosystem around privacy respecting software with the conscious commercialization of self-hosted products and services. We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right and that everyone should own the network, software and their personal data.

We hope you will find the tools here useful. Contributors are welcome!
